// String Calculator

/*
    This classic kata guides you stp by step through the implementation of a calculator
    that receives a Sring as input. It is a good exercise on refactoring and incremental
    implementation. It's also a good candidate for practising TDD.

/* First step
    Create script add that takes a String and returns a String and use console.log()
    to show the result.
*/

/* Second step
    Create function add(number) : 
        - The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers separated by comma, and returns their sum.
        - An empty string will return "0".
        - Example of inputs: "", "1", "1.1,2.2" need to be "3.3" /!\
